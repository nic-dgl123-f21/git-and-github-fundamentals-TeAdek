#### :book: What I learned and What I am still confused about                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
I learnt what respositories, cloning, commits, push, issues and starring respositories represents. But I have some difficult understanding fork, pull request, use GitHub Page to display website and how to revert to previous version of the code
